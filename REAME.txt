# Docker images for JWAS and XSim on IJulia

These docker image files were created by Hailin Su, Rohan Fernando and Hao Cheng. 
Two version of docker files are available to build jwas-docker image. This docker file in `dockerfile-jwas-mini` built the image from ubuntu and the final size is ~800 Mb comparing to `dockerfile-jwas-large`.

## Launch

The command below update local qtlrocks/jwas-docker to the latest version and run it.

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 8008:8008 qtlrocks/jwas-docker
```

The `-v` option can mount your local working directory into the docker container, please see the [docker help page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#mount-volume--v---read-only) for more information. The working dir inside the image is `/home/ubuntu`, so after `cd` into your working directory (containing data files) on your local machine or a server,

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 8008:8008 -v `pwd`:/home/ubuntu/work jwas-docker
```

    Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time,
    to login with a token:
        http://0.0.0.0:8008/?token=75ad671f75b4c47be70591f46bec604997d8a9bd9dd51f0d
```

Then, open the url in an internect browser (IE, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc), change the IP address from `0.0.0.0`:
- to 127.0.0.1 (if running docker and visiting from your local machine), or
- to the domain name (or IP address) of the server (if running docker on server but visiting from your local machine).

#### Valid examples:

If you're trying to copy/paste one of the following urls into your browser, remember to replace the domain name `www.example.com` or ip address `66.66.66.66` of the server, and the string after `token=`, according to your real instance.

- If launched rom your local machine
    >http://127.0.0.1:8008/?token=75ad671f75b4c47be70591f46bec604997d8a9bd9dd51f0d

- if launched from a server with domain name `www.example.com`
    >http://www.example.com:8008/?token=75ad671f75b4c47be70591f46bec604997d8a9bd9dd51f0d

- if launched from a server with IP address `66.66.66.66`
    >http://66.66.66.66:8008/?token=75ad671f75b4c47be70591f46bec604997d8a9bd9dd51f0d
